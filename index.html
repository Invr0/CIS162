    I was born in Whittier, California and have lived in Dallas, Texas for a couple of years, but I reside in Norwalk, Ca.
    Growing up I used to play baseball and a little bit of basketball but mainly for city leagues not highschool.
One day I want to get more into cybersecurity with my major or do anything that makes me happy with my major after completing college.
I am excited about this course and hope to learn alot from this.</p>
